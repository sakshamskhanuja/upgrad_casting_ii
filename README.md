## Casting

### Description

Let’s say you have two variables, a and b:

<ul>
<li>a is an int variable initialised to 6 and</li>
<li>b is a double variable initialised to 5.5 </li>
</ul>

Now you want to add these two variables and print their sum, but you’re not interested in the decimal part of a + b. Write a code that computes a + b and prints out only the whole number part of the result.
